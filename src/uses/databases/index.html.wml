<latemp_subject "Working with Databases in Perl" />

<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>
There are many types of databases:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
If you want to work with databases based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a> (Structured
Query Language), then refer to <a href="#sql">the SQL
databases section of this page</a>. 
</li>
<li>
If you want to use a DBM database (implementing keysâ†’values dictionaries or
mappings inside a file) refer to our 
<a href="#dbm">DBM databases section</a>.
</li>
<li>
If you want xBase (dBase / Clipper / FoxBase) databases refer to our
<a href="#xbase">xBase section</a>.
</li>
<li>
If you want a distributed database (similar to Google's BigTable), see our 
<a href="#distributed">distributed databases section</a>.
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sql">SQL Databases</h2>

<p>
The de-facto standard for working with SQL databases in Perl is 
<a href="http://dbi.perl.org/">DBI</a> (short for Database Interface). It
provides a unified way to perform SQL queries across many database 
backends: <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBD-Pg/">PostgreSQL</a>,
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBD-SQLite/">SQLite</a>, 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBD-mysql/">MySQL</a> (but see
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/anti/mysql/">this page</a>
for some reasons why you may prefer a different system),
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBD-Oracle/">Oracle</a>,
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBD-InterBase/">Firebird</a>,
and others.
</p>

<p>
Above DBI, people wrote some useful abstractions:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBIx-Simple/">DBIx-Simple</a> - an easy
to use Object-Oriented Interface to DBI.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBIx-Class/">DBIx-Class</a> - a
powerful and convenient object-relational mapper. Use of the older and less 
philosophically sound 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Class-DBI/">Class-DBI</a> is
heavily discouraged.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Rose-DB-Object/">Rose-DB-Object</a> - 
another ORM - seems to be much less popular than DBIx-Class, but still actively
maintained.
</p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>
When working with databases make sure you avoid common pitfalls such
as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection">SQL injection
vulnerabilities</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="dbm">DBM Databases</h2>

<ul>

<li>
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/BerkeleyDB/">The BerkeleyDB CPAN
module</a> is the standard module for working with 
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/berkeley-db/index.html">Oracle 
Berkeley DB</a> (formerly Sleepy Cat Berkeley DB) and maps the ANSI C 
library's API closely. Note that Berkeley DB is licensed under
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleepycat_License">the Sleepycat
License</a> which is strong copyleft, and does not allow use for non-open-source
programs.
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://tokyocabinet.sourceforge.net/">Tokyo Cabinet</a> - a modern,
fast and powerful DBM implementation available under the LGPL license (which
permits use in non-open-source projects).
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBM-Deep/">DBM-Deep</a> - a multi-level
hash/array DBM that supports transactions. Reported to be slow, however.
</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="xbase">XBase Databases</h2>

<p>
There seems to be <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBD-XBase/">an
XBase module on CPAN</a> . It seems to be pure-Perl, so it may be slow.
</p>

<h2 id="distributed">Distributed Databases ("No SQL", etc.)</h2>

<p>
Recently, to meet the growing demand for data of some web sites, some people
have switched to using non-centralised, non-SQL based databases that use
a cluster of servers to implement a distributed data storage. This has 
been dubbed "No SQL". You most likely would prefer to use an SQL-based
solution, which should be easily able to handle the data in your scope, but
here is a list of distributed databases just for completeness sake.
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Net-CouchDb/">Net-CouchDb</a> - an
interface to <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">Apache's CouchDb</a>.
</li>

</ul>
