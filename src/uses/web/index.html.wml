<latemp_subject "Perl for CGI and Web Programming" />

<p>
Perl 5 was one of the first available technologies for automating a web-server,
and is still considered one of the most powerful and most cost-effective 
ones, today. Once you learn the core language, and some HTML and HTTP concepts, 
programming a simple CGI callback or form handler is very easy and
straightforward. 
</p>

<p>
Users are recommended to use the excellent <a href="http://stein.cshl.org/WWW/software/CGI/">CGI.pm</a> module (which is included in every Perl 5 
distribution), or one of the other interfaces to the web-server (like 
HTML::Mason or Apache::ASP). Furthermore, there are many CPAN modules 
available that can make many common CGI programming tasks much easier.

<h2>Interfaces</h2>

<h3><a href="http://www.apache-asp.org/">Apache::ASP</a></h3>

<p>
An implementation of the Active Server Pages for Perl on UNIXes. Compatible
with the Perl ASP on Microsoft's IIS server, and so provides a cross-platform
solution. 
</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.masonhq.com/">HTML::Mason</a></h3>

<p>
A portable solution for a dynamic maintenance of a Perl site. Very powerful
and feature-rich.
