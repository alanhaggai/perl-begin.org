<h2>Online Documentation</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.perldoc.com/">Perl-Doc</a> - contains searchable index
for the core perl documentation. 
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.mongueurs.net/perlfr/perl.html">French version of the Perl
Manual</a> - a bit out-of-date, but still very pertinent for beginners.
</p>


<h2>Books</h2>

<h3><a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/pperl3/">Programming Perl, 3rd 
Edition</a></h3>

<p>
The Bible of Perl. Makes an easier and more organized read than the online
core documentation, and provides explanation for every last nuance of the 
Perl language. Also contains a lot of jokes and Perl musings, and an 
introduction to the culture behind Perl.
</p>

<p>
Not recommended as an introducory Perl book, but still makes a very good read 
after the language is learned to a working extent.
</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/cookbook/">The Perl Cookbook</a></h3>

<p>
A book that contains a long list of code snippets for achieving certain tasks 
in Perl, with some discussion on how they work and how to customize them.
