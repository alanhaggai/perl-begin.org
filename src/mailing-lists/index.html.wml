<latemp_subject "Mailing Lists" />

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p> 
Generally, your local Perl Mongers mailing list is considered a good place
to ask <b>any</b> perl questions including beginners one. Refer to the <a
href="http://www.pm.org/">Perl Mongers International homepage</a> for <a
href="http://www.pm.org/groups/">a list of them</a>. If you can't find one in
your area, then any PM list you join will be OK, as its members will accept you
there. Perl Mongers are united world-wide in their love for Perl and their
burning desire to get more people to know it and use it as well.
</p>

<p>
Otherwise, you may consider joining one of the mailing lists listed here,
which have a more international focus.
