<p>
    If you are using a UNIX-compatible system (such as Linux or Solaris), most chances
    are that Perl 5 is already installed there. To verify that, type <tt>perl -v</tt>
    inside a command shell, and check that the version of Perl is recent enough. If so, you 
    can easily run Perl scripts there.
</p>

<p>
    Even if this is not the case, you can usually install it from the distribution you
    are using, assuming you are an administrator of the system. Else, given enough quota it 
    is possible to install the most recent version of Perl 5 under your home directory. 
    This procedure can be followed by downloading the latest Perl source from CPAN, and 
    following the instructions in the INSTALL file.
