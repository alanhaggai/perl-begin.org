<latemp_subject "Perl on Win32" />

<p>
    Perl can easily run on Windows and makes for a very powerful and free
    scripting language there. Complete Beginners should probably start
    by downloading an ActiveState's <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/">ActivePerl</a> build and experimenting with it.
</p>

<p>
    Perl code can be written to run perfectly on both Windows and UNIXes, out
    of the box. Most Perl code written by people who know what they are doing
    will be such, and this is the case for most CPAN Perl modules as well.

<h3>Mailing Lists</h3>

<p>
    ActiveState has <a
    href="http://lists.perl.org/showlist.cgi?name=perl-win32-users">a mailing
    list for Win32 users</a>. Generally, Perl for Win32 questions can be
    effectively answered in beginners mailing lists as well, but this mailing
    list may also prove of help especially in regards to Win32-specific Perl
    extensions.
