<h2>About</h2>

<p>
Welcome to the unofficial Perl Beginners' Site. This site provides
links and references to on-line and off-line material that can be used
to learn Perl. It is intended for people who learn Perl 
after knowing one or more languages, as well as for people who are learning
Perl as their first language.

<h2>What is Perl?</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> is a flexible, feature-rich and
powerful high-level language. It is many times referred to as a "scripting
language" albeit this term is very misleading because it can be efficiently
used for many other tasks besides scripting. It is in fact possible to write
numercial applications, GUIs, graphics generation, database applications, WWW
and network scripts, games, and even servers in Perl. And naturally, anything
that combines two or more of these things. ;-) 
</p>

<p>
Perl code can be written very quickly, and although not run as fast as the
most optimized C code, will still usually be fast enough. It is very usual
to achieve in one line of Perl what in ANSI C and many other languages 
requires 100's of lines.
</p>

<p>
Perl has a lot of easily installable ready made modules in 
<a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a> (the Comprehensive Perl Archive 
Network), which make writing Perl code to achieve many tasks even easier.
