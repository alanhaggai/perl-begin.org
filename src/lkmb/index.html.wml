<latemp_subject "LKMB - The Linux Kernel Module Builder" />

<h2>About</h2>
<p>
The Linux Kernel Module Builder (or LKMB) for short is a kernel module
that can be used to build self-contained packages that can be processed
into kernel modules packages. By installing the Perl module system-wide,
it relieves such duplicate functionality, that is needed to maintain
such packages and allows for fast processing and analyzing of them.
</p>

<p>
LKMB can be downloaded from the <a href="$(ROOT)/download/">downloads 
section</a>, and expect it to be on CPAN soon.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>
Currently, one can build a kernel module package that can be compiled against
the current kernel. Most of the other functionality needs to be implemented.
