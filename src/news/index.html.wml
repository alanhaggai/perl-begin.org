<h2 id="news_27_July_2009">27-July-2009: Updates to Perl-Begin.org</h2>

<p>
After the last news item, a lot of work was invested into <a href="$(ROOT)">Perl-Begin.org, the Perl Beginners' Site</a>, making
it even better than it used to be. Here's a summary of the changes:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>
<a href="$(ROOT)learn/who-is-using/">A testimonials page</a>
was added, with some honest-to-God testimonial quotes which are now featured in
the Testimonials side-bar.  
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
There's a new <a href="$(ROOT)IDEs-and-tools/">IDEs and
tools page</a>, featuring some Integrated Development Environments.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
There's a new <a href="$(ROOT)blogs/">page sporting links
to collections of blogs</a>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Several new topical pages were added:
</p>
<ol>

<li><a href="$(ROOT)uses/databases/">Perl and Databases</a></li>

<li><a href="$(ROOT)uses/GUI/">GUI Development in Perl</a></li>

<li><a href="$(ROOT)uses/xml/">Perl for XML Processing</a></li>

<li><a href="$(ROOT)topics/debugging/">Debugging</a></li>

<li><a href="$(ROOT)topics/object-oriented/">Object-oriented 
Programming in Perl</a></li>

<li><a href="$(ROOT)topics/cpan/">Using CPAN</a></li>
</ol>

</li>

<li>
<p>
A <a href="http://sharethis.com/">ShareThis</a> button was added to the
bottom of every page for easy bookmarking and sharing.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Many writing errors (spelling, grammar, syntax, phrasing, etc.) have been
corrected by <a href="http://alanhaggai.org/">Alan Haggai Alavi</a>. He
seems to have a good eye for catching such problems, and I am indebted to
him.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Corrected several broken links including those to Ovid's CGI course.
</p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>
We hope you enjoy the new Perl Beginners' Site and please recommend it
to your friends. All content on Perl-Begin is made available under the Creative

<h2 id="news_14_May_2009">14-May-2009: Many Updates and Corrections</h2>

<p>
Recently, the <a href="$(ROOT)">Perl-Begin site</a> has
seen many updates and corrections. Among them are:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
In <a href="$(ROOT)/platforms/windows/">the Perl on Windows
page</a>, we now recommend the open-source
and community-headed <a href="http://strawberryperl.com/">Strawberry
Perl</a> instead of the proprietary and quirky ActivePerl.
</li>

<li>
<a href="$(ROOT)/contribute/list/">The contributors list</a>
is now in the global navigation menu. This makes sure it will be prominently
featured on all pages of the site, and won't be left out-of-date.
</li>

<li>
<a href="$(ROOT)/uses/sys-admin/">The systems administration page</a> now
contains links to many useful modules.
</li>

<li>
Many new links have been added, both internal and external, and some broken
links have been fixed.
</li>

<li>
The licensing blurb at the bottom was clarified to be CC-by 2.0, or at your
option a later version.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Aside from all that, we'd like to note that our attention has been
directed to an
<a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl5/index.cgi?mailing_lists">effort
on the Perl 5 Wiki to list all Perl-related mailing lists</a>. This effort
needs help, and there are instructions for that, at the link.
</p>

<h2 id="news_07_Jul_2006">07-July-2006: The wiki is now part of <a href="http://perl.net.au/">perl.net.au</a></h2>

<p>
The contents of our wiki were integrated into the 
<a href="http://perl.net.au/">perl.net.au MediaWiki</a> as 
<a href="http://perl.net.au/wiki/New_to_Perl">its "New to Perl?" section</a>.
This was done to consolidate the Perl wiki'ing efforts, because there's much
more action on perl.net.au than there was on our wiki, and for ease of 
maintenace. Our wiki will be removed soon.
</p>

<p>
Also of note is <a href="$(ROOT)/wikis/">a new section of the site on
Perl-related wikis</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="news_04_Nov_2005">04-November-2005: Perlmeme.org</h2>

<p>
There's <a href="http://perlmeme.org/">a new site for Perl beginners called
Perlmeme.org</a>. It collects tutorials, howto documents, and frequently
asked questions (FAQ) lists. I was referred to its developers by a mutual
friend, and since then became heavily involved in its development. (E.g.: some of the material from
my <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Perl/Newbies/">Perl 
for Perl Newbies</a> series, was integrated there. )
</p>

<p>
Perlmeme.org tries to be as up-to-date as possible and is certainly worth 
checking out. On a different note, I'd like to mention that I went over the
material in the 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Perl/Newbies/">Perl 
for Perl Newbies</a> series and heavily updated and corrected it. It should
be much better now.
</p>

<h2 id="news_06_Jun_2005">06-June-2005: Wiki Restored</h2>

<p>
The <a href="<wiki_link />">Wiki</a> was heavily spammed and so was taken
off. Now, a new wiki was set up with a better implementation - 
<a href="http://wikipedia.sourceforge.net/">MediaWiki</a>, and now we monitor
the RSS feed and use other measurements to prevent Spam.
</p>

<p>
All the content of the old wiki was restored.
</p>

<h2 id="news_29_Feb_2004">29-February-2004: New Wiki</h2>

<p>
We now have <a href="<wiki_link />">a new Wiki with a better 
implementation</a>. The previous wiki was dumped because it was a JavaScript
hell and was quite lame in its conventions. The newer wiki implementation 
(<a href="http://www.pmichaud.com/wiki/PmWiki/PmWiki">PmWiki</a> to be exact)
is much better in this and other regards.
</p>

<p>
All the content from the old wiki was transferred to the new one. We hope
you'd like it better.
</p>
