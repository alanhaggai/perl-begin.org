<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>
There are several ways to debug Perl programs, to find the cause of bugs,
and to find a good solution for them. Many Perl beginners don't make use
of the Perl's debuggers, such as the <tt>-d</tt> flag or the various

modules</a>. This is unfortunate because they are very convenient and
can save a lot of time.

<h3 id="devel-trace"><a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Devel-Trace/">Devel-Trace</a></h3>

<p>
Allows one to print each line before it is executed.
</p>

<h3 id="devel-linetrace"><a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Devel-LineTrace/">Devel-LineTrace</a></h3>

<p>
Allows one to assign code to be executed on individual lines in the program.
This allows to use it instead of adding print's to the code, which later need
to be removed.
