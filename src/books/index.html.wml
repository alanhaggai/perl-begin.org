<p>
It is not absolutely necessary to read an organized book to learn Perl. But 
occassionally many people like it better than reading an ad-hoc tutorial
on their computer screeens, and then trying to understand the man pages. Here 
is a list of books that can teach you Perl with some remarks on each book.

<h2><a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/lperl3/">Learning Perl</a></h2>

<book:info 
    authors="Randal L. Schwartz and Tom Phoenix" 
    publisher="oreilly" 
    isbn="0596001320" 
    perlbooksid="101"
    />

<p>
Also referred to as "the Llama Book". Considered
one of the best books for people who are absolute beginners in Perl and even
in programming in general. This book however, does not cover references, 
modules, and objects and other important features of the Perl language. As 
such, you'll usually need to complement your learning by using another
resource.

A book that teaches Perl for people who have no programming experience. Takes
an unusual approach of introducing them to Literate Programming as well,
and using it for creating documentation and better organizing the examples.

<p>
This book teaches Perl for experienced C Programmers. It is comperehensive
and encompassing and tries to focus on Perl code that resembles C as much as 
possible. If you don't know C either, it will probably be of little help.
